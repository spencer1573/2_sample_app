<!--i read this website here, and i'm unsure as to why there is no yield
stackoverflow.com/questions/17457985/yield-and-provide-inside-template
it could be that yeild is in one of the helpers i'll investigate that tomorrow.
it appears that the accompanying yield for this provide is located in 
app/views/layouts/application.html.erb on line 4, 
because thats where it talks about title. 
-->
<% provide(:title, 'Reset password') %>
<h1>Reset password</h1>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
    <!--I'm going to see what happens if i take out the url thing and add it in-->
    <%= form_for(@user, url: password_reset_path(params[:id])) do |f| %>
      <%= render 'shared/error_messages' %>
       
      <%= hidden_field_tag :email, @user.email %>

      <%= f.label :password %>
      <!--I'm going to see what happens if i take out the class thing
          So i believe that form control is some sort of bootstrap 
          identifier it makes the field larger-->
      <%= f.password_field :password, class: 'form-control' %>
        
      <!--I'm going to see what happens if i take out the "Confirmation"
          so if you take out password confirmation then it just 
          says "Password confirmation" -->
      <%= f.label :password_confirmation, "Confirmation" %>
      <%= f.password_field :password_confirmation, class: 'form-control' %>
      

      <%= f.submit "Update password", class: "btn btn-primary" %>
    <% end %>
  </div>
